# Wiki Age Report

Keeping documentation in you Azure DevOps Wiki is a great way to keep it at the fingertips of the people already using Azure DevOps.
However, what happens when that documentation gets written and never updated? It becomes stale, old, and just out-of-date WRONG. This extension aims at giving you a report of the age of your wiki pages.
This will allow you to then keep an eye on the potentially stale documentation, and hopefully give everybody a better documented experience!



Enjoy!
